            <p> Watching movies at the comfort of our homes has been our favorite past-time
              activity ever since the pandemic started. Movie watching has always been a great way to spend some free time with
              friends and families because it allows us to bond over memorable scenes and movie lines.But before heading over to Netflix,

              <h2> What's up next: </h2>
                <p> February typically marks a moment in the movie season when studio strategies seem to split in half.
                  While executives are simultaneously pumping up their awards season contenders ahead of they Oscars,
                  they’re also dumping out the projects they expect to do poorly at the box office.Netflix does not seem to follow
                  that same pattern, however, don't miss February’s line-up of new releases on my next blog post </p>
